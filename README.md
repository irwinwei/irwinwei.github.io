## Thank you for dropping by. My name is Irwin Wei.
You have reached my project portfolio page which continues to grow. I was most recently working in General Insurance (claims) as a Loss Adjuster - we go by other names like "adjuster", "surveyor" or "assessor". If you ever filed an insurance claim for your house, building, shop unit, warehouse, office, power plant, construction site, oil refinery, ship or aircraft, you would likely have met one of us. I have prior experience in consulting, software development and product development.

#### Project 3: Classifying Text according to their SubReddits
##### *Web Scraping | Natural Language Processing | Classification |<a href="https://www.github.com/irwinwei73/GA-DSI-Project-03" target="_blank">> Link to project repository</a>*
The objective was to build an NLP model to analyze the posts from 2 subreddits and determine which one a post belonged to. The subreddits selected for the project were:

- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer" target="_blank">r/TalesFromTheCustomer</a> (comprises accounts of poor customer service encountered by contributors)
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer" target="_blank">r/TalesFromYourServer</a> (comprises contributions from people who work(ed) as waiters/waitresses regarding unreasonable customers they encountered)

The lexicon/vocabulary in both types of posts are very similar. Hence, the challenge is to create a model that relies not only individual words, but also multi-word sequences to tell the posts apart. About 1,000 posts from each subreddit were scraped from the web, resulting in approximately 2,000 rows of data to work with.

#### Project 1: Analysing SAT and ACT Participation Rates
##### *Exploratory Data Analysis |<a href="https://www.github.com/irwinwei73/GA-DSI-Project-01" target="_blank">> Link to project repository</a>*
The objective was to carry out an analysis of the 2017 and 2018 participation rates and the component scores for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and American College Test (ACT) by college students in the US. The analysis first required the data to be cleaned, visualized and explored with specific questions in mind. The normality of the distributions of the component scores were also explored.<br><br>
Lastly, based on external research as to what may have caused the differences in participation rates of the test in 2017 and 2018, we produced recommendations to increase the SAT participation rate in specific states.<br><br>
The group presentation is for the state of Iowa, whereas my personal analysis was for the state of Missouri.
