## Thank you for dropping by. My name is Irwin Wei.
You have reached my project portfolio page which continues to grow. I was most recently working in General Insurance (claims) as a Loss Adjuster - we go by other names like "adjuster", "surveyor" or "assessor". If you ever filed an insurance claim for your house, building, shop unit, warehouse, office, power plant, construction site, oil refinery, ship or aircraft, you would likely have met one of us. I have prior experience in consulting, software development and product development.

The objective was to build an NLP model to analyze the posts from 2 subreddits and determine which one a post belonged to. The subreddits selected for the project were:

- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCustomer" target="_blank">r/TalesFromTheCustomer</a>
- <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourServer" target="_blank">r/TalesFromYourServer</a>

**r/TalesFromTheCustomer** comprises accounts of poor customer service encountered by contributors.<br>
**r/TalesFromYourServer** comprises contributions from people who work(ed) as waiters/waitresses regarding unreasonable customers they encountered at work.<br><br>

The lexicon/vocabulary in both types of posts are very similar. Hence, the challenge is to create a model that relies not only individual words, but also multi-word sequences to tell the posts apart. About 1,000 posts from each subreddit were scraped from the web, resulting in approximately 2,000 rows of data to work with.
